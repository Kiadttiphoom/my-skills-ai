## Objective and stop rule

Optimize for discriminating evidence per reproduction, not hypothesis count or log count. Prefer one probe that separates several mechanisms over repeated snapshots that confirm only that the symptom exists.

Do not impose an arbitrary hypothesis or probe cap. Stop expanding the first-pass plan when all of these are true:

1. Every relevant causal boundary has an invariant and one or more planned observations.
2. Every material hypothesis names a concrete mechanism and has both confirming and rejecting evidence.
3. Every material hypothesis maps to probes that can distinguish it from adjacent causes.
4. Flow sentinels, correlation, ordering, observer cost, privacy, and the selected logging path are covered.
5. Excluded cause families and residual ambiguities are explicit.
6. The full native-breakpoint candidate set has been reviewed; every safe nonredundant location is in the initial batch, and every deferred location has a concrete activation condition.

Treat a hypothesis as material only when code, architecture, runtime conditions, or authoritative incident facts make it plausible and it requires distinct evidence or a distinct repair. Do not generate speculative checklist entries merely to increase coverage counts.

Scale breadth continuously:

- For expensive, flaky, destructive, timing-sensitive, production-only, user-only, or uncertain reproduction opportunities, cover every material boundary before the first failing run.
- For cheap reproductions, still install every safe, nonredundant first-pass breakpoint or observation point already justified by the causal map; cheap replay is not a reason to default to one or two locations. When pausing or instrumentation creates severe observer risk, enumerate the full candidate set but defer only the unsafe locations with a concrete reason and activation condition, use non-pausing probes for the affected distinctions, and record any remaining ambiguity.
- When broad instrumentation could hide the bug, prefer invariant, ordering, and boundary probes with bounded payloads instead of abandoning coverage discipline.

## Failure contract

Record these facts before generating hypotheses:

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Expected | Observable correct behavior |
| Observed | Exact failure |
| Trigger | Smallest realistic action or input sequence |
| Scope | Affected user, tenant, route, job, device, service, data, or environment |
| Frequency | Always, percentage, burst, first-run, after-idle, under load, and so on |
| Timing | Immediate, delayed, after retry, after navigation, or another boundary |
| Last known good | Version, date, configuration, schema, or deployment boundary |
| Reproduction cost | Low, medium, high, or single opportunity |
| Constraints | Actions, systems, data, identities, or fields that must not be changed or disclosed |
| Completion | A real terminal outcome, or a bounded observable checkpoint for an intentionally long-lived flow |

Convert vague symptoms into observable assertions. For example, replace “save is broken” with “the UI reports success for operation B, but a refresh reads persisted version A from the authoritative source.”

## Causal map

Trace backward from the symptom to authoritative input. Use a compact graph:

```text
input / user intent
  -> handler or ingress
  -> validation and state ownership
  -> transformation
  -> async or transport boundary
  -> cache / persistence / external effect
  -> response or event reconciliation
  -> observed symptom
```

For each boundary, record:

- The identity, value, decision, version, or ordering relationship that crosses it.
- The invariant that must hold before and after it.
- How a correct value could first become incorrect there.
- The observation that distinguishes this boundary from its neighbors.
- Whether a shared causal-cut probe can cover several paths.

Instrument causal cuts first: points every plausible path must cross. Add branch-specific probes only when a cut cannot distinguish alternatives.

## Material hypotheses

Enumerate breadth-first before ranking:

1. Generate direct mechanisms that could produce the symptom.
2. Move upstream one causal boundary at a time until reaching authoritative input, persisted state, configuration, or an external dependency.
3. Add applicable timing, lifecycle, concurrency, resource, environment, and deployment mechanisms.
4. Add compound hypotheses only when two individually valid behaviors must interact.
5. Ground every hypothesis in inspected code, architecture, or incident facts.
6. Define confirming and rejecting observations before assigning priority.
7. Rank after coverage, not before it.

Name a mechanism, not a category. Prefer “attempt 1 finishes after attempt 2 and overwrites version 2 because the commit path does not reject obsolete work” over “race condition.”

## Cause-family checklist

Cover only applicable families and record a reason for material exclusions:

- **Input and contract:** malformed, stale, duplicated, truncated, encoded, defaulted, coerced, schema-skewed, or unit/identity disagreement.
- **Control flow:** wrong branch, guard, flag, early return, retry, idempotency, fallback, swallowed exception, or apparent success.
- **State and lifecycle:** stale snapshot, initialization order, owner mismatch, missed reset, leaked state, lost update, double mutation, or work after teardown.
- **Timing and concurrency:** out-of-order completion, lock gap, TOCTOU, duplicate delivery, cancellation failure, missed event, debounce, throttle, deadline, or backoff interaction.
- **Cache and persistence:** wrong key, namespace, TTL, invalidation, replica lag, transaction boundary, partial write, schema migration, serialization, or cache/source disagreement.
- **Transformation:** dropped, renamed, rounded, reordered, merged, normalized, or version-dependent fields.
- **External dependency and I/O:** timeout, partial or semantically invalid success, retry amplification, rate limit, proxy, filesystem, queue, webhook, or dependency drift.
- **Configuration and environment:** flag, permission, locale, path, runtime, region, build, deployment, or configuration refresh skew.
- **Security and identity:** wrong principal, tenant, scope, session rotation, authorization cache, impersonation, or row-level policy.
- **Resource and pressure:** memory, pool, thread, file descriptor, queue, payload, storage, backpressure, load shedding, timeout budget, or instrumentation overhead.
- **UI and event systems:** duplicate handlers, stale closures, reconciliation, hydration, propagation, focus, composition, navigation, or stale async commits.
- **Build and dependency boundaries:** stale artifacts, generated code, module duplication, conditional exports, incompatible versions, or source/bundle mismatch.

## Hypothesis deduplication

Keep hypotheses separate when the originating boundary, expected order, confirming value, responsible owner, or required repair differs.

Merge variants when the same probes would produce the same observations and the same repair would eliminate them. Preserve merged variants in a note so contradictory evidence can reopen them.

Do not discard a material hypothesis merely because it is low priority. Map it to a shared boundary or invariant probe when marginal observer cost is small; otherwise record the residual ambiguity.

## Coverage plan

Create one JSON file inside the authorized workspace scratch area. Use it as the authority for plan validation, collector location synchronization, and expected-probe analysis.

  }
}
```

Use these probe roles: `flow-start`, `flow-terminal`, `observation-checkpoint`, `boundary`, `branch`, `state`, `async`, `external`, `exception`, `invariant`, or `observation`.

Apply the reproduction-run rules in `SKILL.md`. For the exceptional agent-autonomous shape, record the current user's explicit delegation:

```json
{
  "run": {
    "runId": "initial",
    "reproductionOwner": "agent",
    "reproductionDelegation": {
      "target": "agent",
      "scope": "remaining-runs",
      "effectiveRunId": "initial",
      "currentUserDirective": "Have the agent investigate this runtime failure."
    },
    "steps": ["run the deterministic reproduction"]
  }
}
```

`run.reproductionOwner` applies only to the shown `runId`. For non-user ownership, set `reproductionDelegation.scope` to `single-run` or `remaining-runs` and require `effectiveRunId` to equal that `runId`. Preserve completed ownership in the investigation ledger before replacing the plan's current `run` block.

Always include `debuggerStrategy`. Set `mode` to `attached`, `unavailable`, or `unsafe`, and give a concrete non-empty `reason`. Every mode must enumerate a candidate breakpoint batch that covers every declared boundary and hypothesis. For `attached`, include at least one `initial` breakpoint and explicitly defer only constrained candidates. For `unavailable` or `unsafe`, keep every candidate `deferred`; this records the complete breakpoint set without claiming it was installed, while structured probes provide the runtime evidence.

Each breakpoint requires a unique `breakpointId`, fixed `kind: "pause"`, a workspace-relative numeric-line `location`, `activation` (`initial` or `deferred`), a concrete `rationale`, a non-empty `inspect` list naming the stack frames, locals, or expressions to examine, one or more resolving `boundaryIds` entries, and one or more resolving `hypothesisIds`. When `boundaryIds` contains multiple boundaries, require a non-empty `sharedBoundaryRationale` explaining why the same physical paused frame genuinely exposes all of them; omit that field for a single boundary. The same normalized source `location` is one physical breakpoint regardless of condition, so combine any conditions and merge its mappings into one entry; duplicate entries are invalid and breakpoint counts include unique physical locations only. Use the optional `condition` only to scope hits to the failing run, correlation, identity, or state; never use an arbitrary hit limit as a substitute for a complete batch. A deferred breakpoint also requires `activateWhen` and one structured `deferReason`: `tool-unavailable`, `observer-risk`, or `privacy-risk`. An initial breakpoint must omit both fields. In `unavailable` mode every candidate uses `tool-unavailable`; in `unsafe` mode use only `observer-risk` or `privacy-risk`. Defer neither because a hypothesis ranks lower nor because an earlier breakpoint may be inconclusive. Because every breakpoint `location` must already be concrete, keep a dynamically unresolved source site in `coverage.residualAmbiguities` and map its boundary and hypothesis to the nearest concrete upstream or downstream surrogate breakpoint. Residual ambiguity never waives concrete coverage. Once a pause resolves the site's `path:line`, add the full newly justified batch and revalidate before continuing.

Native pause breakpoints are separate from `probes`: they do not emit all-occurrence events, do not satisfy structured-probe coverage, are not synchronized to the collector, and cannot prove absence from a non-hit alone. When pauses would alter the failure, use `mode: "unsafe"` plus validated non-pausing structured probes instead of shrinking the plan to a token breakpoint set. A native debugger logpoint is formal evidence only when it is represented as a plan probe and routed through the same selected project/host logger or language-native collector adapter; raw debugger-console output remains supplemental.

Omitting `run.completion` preserves the default `flow-terminal` requirement. For an intentionally long-lived flow, set `run.completion` to `{"mode":"observation-checkpoint","condition":"<bounded observable stop condition>"}` and include an `observation-checkpoint` sentinel. The checkpoint closes only the evidence window; it does not claim that the business stream terminated.

Write every probe location as a workspace-relative source path followed by a positive numeric line, for example `src/save.ts:88`. Revalidate after instrumentation moves a probe.

Give every probe the fixed `expectedOccurrence: "every-execution"` value and an `eventPolicy` object containing exactly `mode` and `payloadControl`. Set `mode` to `all-occurrences`; neither field accepts free-form cardinality policy.

`payloadControl` is a strict object containing exactly:

- `maxEventBytes`: a positive integer limiting the encoded size of one event.
- `fieldBounds`: an object whose keys must also appear in that probe's `dataFields`. Each entry must contain at least one positive integer bound from `maxBytes`, `maxItems`, or `maxDepth`, and no other keys. Use an empty object when the whole-event byte limit is sufficient.
- `overflowPolicy`: the fixed value `reject-run`. An overflow makes the evidence run incomplete; it must not silently drop, merge, or replace the occurrence.

The validator rejects unknown keys at every plan object, including the top level, failure contract, exclusions, run/delegation/completion, boundaries, hypotheses, debugger strategy and breakpoints, probes, policies, and coverage gate, rather than letting ignored instructions bypass the plan. The legacy free-text `expectedEvents`, string `payloadControl`, and `volumeControl` forms are invalid. Free text remains necessary for the failure contract, reproduction steps, breakpoint rationale and activation, evidence, redactions, and ambiguities, so machine validation cannot infer whether every sentence is descriptive or imperative. Perform a mandatory semantic review: require the initial breakpoint batch to contain every safe nonredundant candidate, require each deferral and multi-boundary mapping to be credible, and reject descriptions that direct debug instrumentation to throttle, filter, deduplicate, or otherwise suppress occurrences. Product behavior may contain those mechanisms, but prose cannot override `expectedOccurrence` or `eventPolicy`. Choose and enforce payload bounds before activation so every execution can enqueue its distinct event; never add a second occurrence/cardinality policy in prose or another field.

Map every boundary and hypothesis from at least one probe through `boundaryIds` and `hypothesisIds`. Run:

```bash
"$PYTHON_BIN" <SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/debug_plan.py validate <PLAN_FILE>
```

Do not claim the coverage gate passed when validation fails. Update the same plan rather than creating divergent location or expected-probe lists.

## Probe graph

Use stable semantic probe IDs.

- **Flow sentinels:** record start and terminal outcome so missing interior events are interpretable.
- **Boundary pairs:** capture compact identity, version, hash, and invariant fields on both sides of transformations, service calls, persistence, and caches.
- **Branch probes:** record the selected branch and bounded operands that determined it.
- **State probes:** capture before/after versions, ownership, mutation reason, selected diffs, and invariant results.
- **Async probes:** capture schedule, start, finish, cancel, timeout, retry, attempt, generation, task identity, and monotonic time.
- **External probes:** capture operation class, destination class, request identity, attempt, timeout budget, semantic result, duration, and bounded error metadata.
- **Exception probes:** capture type/code, handling branch, retry/fallback decision, and whether the error became visible or apparent success.
- **Invariant probes:** record invariant name, pass/fail, compact operands, and owning boundary.

## First-pass breakpoint batch

Use native debugger breakpoints when an attached debugger can safely pause the target. Treat “one batch” as one pre-execution setup phase, not necessarily one API request:

1. Build the complete candidate list from the causal map before setting the first breakpoint. Include failing-flow ingress and symptom boundaries, both sides of state or ownership transfer, discriminating branches, before/after mutation, async schedule/start/settle/cancel, cache and persistence access, external-call request/result, exception/fallback, invariants, and completion.
2. Remove only locations that are observationally redundant with the same paused frame. A breakpoint may map multiple boundaries only with a credible `sharedBoundaryRationale` that the same frame exposes each one. Merge every duplicate normalized source location, combine any conditions, and count the resulting unique physical locations. Keep concrete unsafe, unavailable, or privacy-sensitive candidates in the plan as deferred entries with structured reasons. Record dynamically unresolved source sites in `coverage.residualAmbiguities` until they resolve to concrete locations, while mapping their boundaries and hypotheses to nearest concrete surrogate breakpoints. Do not stop at an arbitrary count, and do not use reproduction cheapness, hypothesis rank, or possible inconclusive evidence at an earlier breakpoint to justify a one- or two-breakpoint default.
3. Install every remaining `initial` breakpoint before the first `run` or `continue`. When the debugger tool sets one location per call, issue all calls back-to-back before execution resumes.
4. Give each breakpoint one falsifiable question and an explicit inspection list. Prefer conditions based on the target run, correlation, request, operation, identity, or state so setup traffic does not pause; avoid hit-count caps that discard relevant matching occurrences.
5. At a pause, inspect the planned stack and values first. If dynamic dispatch, a concrete type, or the call stack reveals another material causal interval, add the whole newly justified breakpoint set before the next `continue`.
6. Prefer validated non-pausing structured probes for timing-sensitive, concurrent, high-frequency, lifecycle, or long-lived work. Treat a debugger logpoint as formal evidence only when it is also a plan probe using the validated logging path. A pause-only breakpoint or raw console logpoint is supplementary and never replaces an all-occurrence structured probe required for continuity or absence claims.

Set `coverage.firstPassBreakpointBatchReviewed` only after this review and installation decision is complete. Report initial and deferred breakpoint counts in the reproduction handoff even when the debugger is unavailable or unsafe.

## Observer cost

Estimate dynamic event cardinality and payload bytes, not static statement count. Every runtime occurrence of every active probe must produce one distinct debug event. Keep cardinality intact while bounding strings, arrays, stack depth, and canonical non-secret hashes as declared by `eventPolicy.payloadControl`.

Never sample, rate-limit, throttle, debounce, filter, coalesce, aggregate, suppress, deduplicate, or replace active probe occurrences. Never apply once-per-key, once-per-correlation, once-per-flow, change-only, failure-only, or event-count-cap behavior. When the failure contract depends on an upstream event count, place its source probe at the authoritative callback or dispatch before any pre-existing reduction; observing only a downstream throttled or filtered callback does not prove upstream cardinality. Reduce observer cost only by choosing fewer probe locations before the run or by shrinking each event's fields; after a probe is active, send every occurrence.

Do not interpret observer-cost review as permission to install a token native-breakpoint set. Enumerate the full breakpoint batch first, then move pause-unsafe distinctions to non-pausing probes or explicit deferred entries.

For every application `fetch` and every source event from a real-time flow, preserve one debug event per occurrence throughout the covered page lifetime. Follow [browser-debugging.md](./browser-debugging.md).

## Long-lived flows

Treat SSE, WebSocket, subscription, long-poll, and `ReadableStream` flows as first-class when they are intentionally open:

1. Distinguish connection/request state from evidence delivery. A browser Network-panel `Pending` row can be a live business stream or an unfinished debug HTTP request; it is not itself proof of a stall or lost event.
2. Instrument the real dispatch, decoder, or reader loop. Record open/headers, every source-event occurrence at each active probe with the correlation-scoped top-level logging sequence plus a separately named domain source sequence when its owner differs, reconnect, close, cancel, error, and the configured observation checkpoint. Do not clone, tee, or consume a response body merely to observe it when that would change backpressure, cancellation, or memory behavior.
3. Choose a checkpoint condition tied to an observable assertion, event count, protocol state, operator action, or justified product deadline. Do not wait for an intentionally open business stream to terminate.
4. At the checkpoint, emit the planned sentinel, snapshot the producer's available source/emitted count, and verify the corresponding persisted NDJSON records through that sentinel. Let later business events continue; the checkpoint closes only the bounded evidence interval.
5. If the selected logger exposes an ordinary completion signal, wait for it only at the natural checkpoint. If reload, navigation, process loss, memory exhaustion, or unavailable durable storage can discard an unfinished event, use an authoritative producer/server-side logger or mark continuity incomplete.

No page-local logging path can guarantee an unbounded producer across every lifecycle failure. The enforceable contract is: emit one independent event for every active-probe occurrence, never filter, coalesce, aggregate, suppress, deduplicate, overwrite, or delete it, and claim only the bounded interval whose sentinels and generic persisted counts are actually present. If the selected logger cannot establish exact delivery, record that limitation and keep absence claims inconclusive.

## Correlation and absence

Use a hierarchy that preserves both flow grouping and local ordering:

```text
runId
  -> parentCorrelationId / flowId
      -> operationId
          -> requestId or child correlationId
              -> attempt / generation / sequence
```

Reuse existing identifiers. Do not introduce headers or parameters that alter preflight, caching, routing, signing, or authorization behavior merely to improve logging.

Do not infer strict distributed order from wall-clock timestamps alone. Capture wall time for cross-process alignment and monotonic time for local duration and ordering.

Treat a missing probe as evidence only when flow sentinels, collector continuity, enclosing branch or boundary execution, current source locations and endpoint, the `all-occurrences` policy, and available source/emitted/persisted counts prove it should have arrived. Otherwise mark it `INCONCLUSIVE` or `NOT_REACHED`.

## Coverage gate

Before the first failing reproduction, require:

- [ ] The failure contract and current run owner are precise; ownership is user by default, and every non-user delegation has an allowed scope plus an `effectiveRunId` matching the current `runId`.
- [ ] Applicable cause families were reviewed and every exclusion has a reason.
- [ ] Every relevant causal boundary has an invariant and mapped probe.
- [ ] Every material hypothesis has both confirming and rejecting evidence.
- [ ] Every boundary and hypothesis is covered by at least one probe, and every probe reference resolves.
- [ ] `debuggerStrategy` records attached, unavailable, or unsafe status, and its initial/deferred candidates cover every boundary and hypothesis. When attached, every safe nonredundant initial breakpoint is installed before the first continue. When unavailable or unsafe, all candidates are deferred with mode-compatible structured reasons and validated non-pausing probes cover runtime evidence. `coverage.firstPassBreakpointBatchReviewed` is true.
- [ ] A flow-start sentinel and the configured flow-terminal or observation-checkpoint sentinel exist.
- [ ] Correlation and ordering survive every relevant async or service boundary.
- [ ] `coverage.eventCardinalityReviewed` is true after proving that every active probe uses `expectedOccurrence: every-execution` plus `eventPolicy.mode: all-occurrences` and emits one event for every execution.
- [ ] Every free-text plan field passed semantic contradiction review; none instructs the debug instrumentation to select, cap, combine, or suppress occurrences.
- [ ] Payload bytes and perturbation risk were reviewed without introducing any event-cardinality control.
- [ ] Sensitive fields are excluded or redacted.
- [ ] Logging is failure-tolerant and cannot block the product path.
- [ ] The plan validator succeeds.
- [ ] Instrumented code passes the narrowest relevant compile, type, or syntax check.
- [ ] Collector health, endpoint freshness, expected-probe sync, and one bounded test-event persistence check succeed through the selected project/host logger or target-runtime native HTTP adapter.
- [ ] Every active source or causal sequence and every browser/process lifecycle evidence-loss boundary is covered or declared residual.
- [ ] The run ID is unique and stale evidence is cleared.

Do not include dashboard visibility in this gate. A dashboard can improve operator experience but does not prove evidence delivery.

## Post-run analysis

1. Summarize the exact run before reading raw volume.
2. Select the failing parent correlation, operation, request, and attempt.
3. Verify the start and configured completion sentinels, available source/emitted/persisted counts, missing expected probes, send or serialization errors, and source or causal-sequence gaps. Treat delivery-dependent absence as inconclusive when the selected logger cannot establish exact persisted counts.
4. Evaluate every hypothesis against its confirming and rejecting evidence.
5. Identify the earliest invalid value, decision, ordering, or external result.
6. Trace it forward through boundaries to the observed symptom.
7. Separate root cause, enabling conditions, downstream effects, and residual ambiguity.
8. Read only the raw causal interval needed to cite proof.

If all instrumented boundaries are correct, add probes only inside the smallest unresolved interval. If the failing flow never reached the suspected subsystem, move upstream. Never repeat a rejected path without new contradictory evidence.
