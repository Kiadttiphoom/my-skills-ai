# Investigation and Root-Cause Ledger

Use one evolving Markdown ledger whenever repair is in scope or an investigation spans a user handoff, context compaction, multiple runs, an expensive reproduction, or a request for durable evidence. Keep the validated coverage-plan JSON file as the authority for debugger strategy, initial and deferred native breakpoints, boundaries, hypotheses, structured probes, and coverage. Carry the same ledger through evidence collection, collector-session continuity or replacement, repair, verification, and cleanup; do not create a diagnosis-only stopping point for repair-scoped work.

Treat lifecycle scope as `investigation > collector session > run`. One reported bug owns one investigation ledger. That investigation normally reuses one collector session identified by an exact active ready file, while each failing, blind-spot, or verification pass gets a distinct `runId`. A user reply, evidence-analysis turn, context compaction, repair transition, or new `runId` changes neither the investigation nor its active collector session.

## Creation and placement

Create the ledger after the initial coverage plan validates and before the first repair, expensive or user-owned reproduction, or multi-run transition. For short, agent-owned, diagnosis-only work that remains within one turn and does not require durable evidence, the validated plan and final evidence summary may be sufficient.

Prefer this order:

1. Use an established incident or RCA directory when the user requests durable evidence.
2. Otherwise use `.debug-logs/<INVESTIGATION_ID>.root-cause.md` as an ephemeral ledger.
3. Keep the path inside the authorized workspace and never overwrite an unrelated report.

Record the coverage-plan path rather than duplicating its full hypothesis-probe matrix. Create one ledger per investigation, not per collector session or run, and update the same file even when the leading theory changes or an allowed collector replacement occurs.

## Update rules

Read the current ledger before every update. Append one investigation row for each material transition:

- initial validated plan;
- collector session established, resumed, unreachable, explicitly isolated, replaced, or stopped;
- completed run reached its bounded checkpoint, delivery confidence was recorded, and the collector was frozen for a stable analysis snapshot;
- collector resumed for future requests in a prepared failing, blind-spot, or verification run;
- failing reproduction analysis;
- targeted blind-spot run;
- root-cause change;
- diagnosis-only terminal handoff;
- in-scope repair decision;
- failed verification;
- successful verification;
- cleanup or retention decision.

Preserve rejected and superseded paths with the evidence that displaced them. Do not retry one without new contradictory evidence. Separate verified facts from inference, and separate root cause from enabling conditions and downstream symptoms.

Before replacing the coverage plan's current `run` block, append the completed run to the reproduction-run history. Never rewrite its ID, purpose, owner, delegation, evidence reference, or terminal status.

Before continuing across a user reply, evidence-analysis turn, context compaction, repair transition, or new run, read the ledger's exact active ready file and execute `debug_session.py resume --ready-file <READY_FILE>`. Never find a continuation session by scanning the workspace. A successful resume preserves the same collector, port, dashboard, evidence path, and ownership and must not start another collector or reopen browser UI. If the ready file is missing or its collector is unreachable, or the user or host explicitly requires isolation or replacement, append the prior session status and reason before recording the replacement as active.

## Status model

Use these document statuses:

- `Planning`
- `Instrumented`
- `Awaiting reproduction`
- `Analyzing`
- `Confirmed root cause`
- `Diagnosis complete; repair not in scope`
- `Repair applied; awaiting verification`
- `Root cause repaired and verified`
- `Still failing`
- `Incomplete`

Use these hypothesis statuses, matching the coverage plan:

- `PENDING`
- `CONFIRMED`
- `REJECTED`
- `INCONCLUSIVE`
- `NOT_REACHED`
- `SUPERSEDED`

Use `NOT_REACHED` only when enclosing evidence proves the flow terminated or branched before the hypothesized path. Treat an otherwise missing probe as `INCONCLUSIVE`.

Set the document status to `Analyzing` after the completed run's terminal or observation checkpoint, generic persisted-count confidence, and current collector state are recorded. When a stable snapshot is needed, confirm that the collector is frozen before reading evidence. Resume only for future requests after the next run is prepared.

## Collector-session history

Record every collector session used by the investigation in chronological order. For each session, preserve its session ID, exact ready file, evidence file, endpoint or dashboard URL, ownership and cleanup policy, status, current recording state, and any replacement reason. Mark exactly one reachable session as active. A successful session `resume` updates the existing history entry rather than adding a new session and never changes its recording state.

Use statuses such as `active`, `missing`, `unreachable`, `replaced`, and `stopped`. Start another session only after recording that the active ready file is missing or unreachable, or the user or host's explicit isolation/replacement directive. A new run alone never adds a collector-session entry.

## Reproduction-run history

Record every completed failing, blind-spot, and verification run. Include its terminal or observation checkpoint, available source/emitted/persisted counts, delivery limitations, and collector state used for analysis. Treat ownership as run-scoped and immutable. For non-user ownership, record the delegation target, scope, effective run ID, and current-user directive. A request for the agent to investigate completed evidence changes neither the completed run nor any future run owner.

## Root-cause proof

Require evidence for all three links:

1. The originating invalid state, decision, ordering, or external result.
2. Its propagation across the relevant boundaries.
3. The observed symptom under the failure contract.

Cite run, parent flow, operation, child correlation or request, sequence/time, probe ID, location, and bounded values. Do not promote a hypothesis from correlation alone.

For an in-scope repair, additionally record:

- the owning boundary and violated invariant;
- why the repair eliminates the causal mechanism;
- why every changed layer is necessary and unrelated cleanup is excluded;
- the same relevant probe and invariant results from a separate verification run.

## Retention and cleanup

Keep the plan and ledger through targeted reruns, intermediate log clears, failed verification, and incomplete investigations.

After success:

- Retain them when the user requests evidence or the repository has a durable RCA convention.
- Otherwise update the terminal diagnosis or verification status and cleanup decision, then delete owned ephemeral files.
- Use `debug_session.py stop --delete-root-cause-document <PATH>` only for a ledger inside the workspace after a terminal diagnosis or successful repair verification.
- Delete the plan separately only when it is owned by the current invocation and no evidence retention was requested.

Never infer cleanup from Git status because `.debug-logs/` is commonly ignored. Never delete host-owned evidence or an incomplete investigation unless the user explicitly requests it.
